## TO DO
* Get C code running (Mona)
* Make a G-cloud instance we can all access (Maya)
* Draft Milestone due Nov 16 (Maya)
  > UPDATE 11/12: I have started a Latex doc for this. It's linked in the [Deliverables](./Deliverables) folder above. You should be able to edit the doc direcly in Overleaf (may need to create an account -- use your berkeley.edu email). There is a way to link the tex code for the document to this GitHubRepo but I spent a few hrs trying to figure it out and failed (hence the weird milestone link above). If either of you have experience with this feel free to set me straight! Otherwise editing in Overleaf seems easiest for now...
  > NEXT STEPS: obviously this document needs quite a bit of work.(I've really only added in our proposal). I am feeling stuck because I think that I don't fully understand the motivation for our project. Or maybe because I was thinking of this as a 'learn about something' kind of task instead of a 'have a problem and use an algorithm to solve it' kind of task.' I'm going to start a discussion about this on Slack. 
* Look for baseline model implementations in Python (Roseanna)
  > UPDATE 11/13: A list of publicly available baseline implementations is here [Baseline Models](./ReferencePapers/BaselineModels); they all appear to be in C. 
  > NEXT STEPS: Contact Duong et al. regarding baseline implementations
